PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Green energy developer Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has advanced its Holmaneset green hydrogen project, in Norway, to the next phase by completing a scoping study to identify potential locations for the 300 MW green hydrogen and green ammonia facility and associated port facilities. Currently in the early feasibility phase of the project, FFI is conducting several environmental and social studies to assess its viability and developing a project concept in line with Norwegian regulations, FFI’s environmental and social policies and values, and international good practice. The project has commenced the zoning plan process, which is a key component of the feasibility phase. This process, which will be undertaken in cooperation with the municipality, will include a series of investigations, including an environmental impact assessment, and provide several opportunities for stakeholders to interact and formally comment on the zoning plan documentation. Consideration has been given to a range of factors to help position the project for success, such as existing grid and power capacity, proximity to existing infrastructure, land availability, water sources, topography, and the local environment and surrounding communities. FFI CEO Mark Hutchinson said Norway had significant potential to lead the way for green hydrogen and green ammonia production based on availability of renewable energy, proximity to the European market, and skilled workforce. “The development of green hydrogen and green ammonia provides opportunities for Norway to achieve its ambitious goals to reduce European greenhouse emissions and become a leader in the transition to a low carbon society,” Hutchinson said.
