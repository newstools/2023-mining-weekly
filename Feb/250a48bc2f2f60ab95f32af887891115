Scandinavia-based Ethiopian gold exploration and boutique mining company Akobo Minerals has won the 2023 ESG Nature Award at the Investing in African Mining Indaba, held in Cape Town this week. “With over 15 000 attendees, we are delighted to have been recognised on such a prestigious occasion,” the company acclaims. “We are proud to have been recognised for our environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts by winning this prestigious award for our ESG work by such an industry-respected organisation. “We understand that to be a successful company, ESG will always be at the heart of our activities at a community, country and global level and we are honoured that Indaba has identified our programme as meeting the highest standards in the mining industry,” says Akobo CEO Jørgen Evjen. The 2023 Mining Indaba conference and exhibition had an increased focus on ESG and sustainability issues. As ESG moves from strategy to implementation, the event will look at key issues such as ESG metrics, sustainable development goals and better community engagement. Akobo says it is focused on delivering sustainable value for its employees, stakeholders and host communities, both now and into the future. The company believes the protection of the health and wellbeing of staff employees, acting as a custodian of the local environment and being an advocate for sustainable economic empowerment in the Ethiopian host communities are both the right things to do and are a fundamental business imperative, it notes.
