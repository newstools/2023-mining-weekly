Aim-listed Goldplat has appointed Gerard Kemp chairperson, with immediate effect. He succeeds Gerard Kisbey-Green who is stepping down as chairperson, but will remain as an independent nonexecutive director. Goldplat has gold recovery operations in South Africa and Ghana. The Ghanaian operation sources raw materials from mines in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mauritania, as well as Ghana. Kemp has been an independent nonexecutive director of Goldplat since September 2022 and, with his significant industry and investment banking experience, the company believes he is well qualified to guide the board of directors. CEO Werner Klingenberg has thanked Kisbey-Green for his guidance and says he looks forward to Kisbey-Green’s continued support and the value he will add to the company. “I am also delighted to have Kemp appointed as chair[person], whose experience in industry, investment banking and dealmaking has already been of value to the group. I believe he is well placed to guide the board on our current trajectory going forward,” says Klingenberg.
