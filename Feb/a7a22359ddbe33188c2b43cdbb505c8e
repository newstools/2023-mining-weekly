Toronto- and New York-listed Centerra Gold said on Monday that its Öksüt mine, in central Türkiye, continued to operate normally after two powerful earthquakes struck the south-eastern part of the country – about 180 km from the mine site. The miner confirmed that there were no injuries to its employees or contractors at the mine or at the company’s other offices within Türkiye. Initial inspections have not detected any damage to the infrastructure at the Öksüt mine. “Centerra offers its condolences to the people of Türkiye and all those that have lost loved ones in this natural disaster,” said Centerra interim president and CEO Paul Wright. He added that the company had mobilised an emergency response team from the Öksüt mine to assist Turkish State emergency preparedness authorities and regional disaster response organisations.
