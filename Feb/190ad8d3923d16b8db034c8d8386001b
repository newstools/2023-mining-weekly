Helium and natural gas supplier Renergen has embarked on an accelerated bookbuild to raise funds for the Phase 2 expansion of its Virginia gas project, in South Africa's Free State. It intends to place 4.6-million new shares, representing about 3.2% of the company's existing share capital, to qualifying South African investors. The price per ordinary share at which the placing shares will be placed will be decided at the close of the bookbuild. Investors will receive placing shares listed and trading on the JSE. The Virginia project’s Phase 2 was declared a strategic integrated project (SIP) by South African authorities in December. As an SIP, the project will benefit from sped-up processes relating to any application for approval, authorisation, licence, permission or exemption, and processes relating to any consultation and participation required by the relevant laws must, as far as possible, run concurrently. Timeframes for authorisations, licences, permissions and/or exemptions are reduced significantly towards a targeted 57-day timeframe for approval outside of timeframes stipulated for public consultation processes.
