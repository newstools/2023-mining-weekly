Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has joined USA Rare Earth as a strategic adviser, the vertically integrated magnet technology company announced on Thursday. CEO Tom Schneberger said that Pompeo’s government service, combined with his aerospace manufacturing background, would provide a valuable perspective as the company moved to establish a fully integrated US-based supply chain. USA Rare Earth is recommissioning a scalable, sintered rare-earth magnet manufacturing system in the US, while developing the first domestic heavy rare earth production facility. "I am pleased to join the USA Rare Earth team as we build a fully integrated, US-based supply chain for rare earth elements and permanent magnets. USA Rare Earth's supply is critically important to reduce foreign dependencies while creating additional American jobs,” commented Pompeo.
