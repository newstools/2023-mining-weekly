SAO PAULO - Brazil's Vale said on Thursday its fourth-quarter net profit fell 30.4%, under pressure from reduced production and lower iron ore prices, while still beating analysts' forecasts. Vale, one of the world's largest iron-ore miners, posted net income of $3.724-billion, compared to the $2.5-billion forecast compiled by Refinitiv, or 82c a share, beating the Refinitiv forecast of 63c. Iron ore production was down 1% in the quarter to 80.85-million tonnes, with an average realized price of iron-ore fines of $95.6/t, compared to $107/t in the fourth quarter in 2021. Vale's quarterly net was hit by a financial loss of $658-million resulting from foreign exchange fluctuation and other factors, reversing the $3.16-billion gain seen a year earlier. Net operating revenues fell 8.8% to $11.94-billion while costs and expenses rose by 9.2% to $7.895-billion. The company's proforma adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) fell by 27% to $5-billion. On a sequential basis, the company's Ebitda rose $1-billion due to higher iron-ore sales volumes and higher realized nickel and copper prices. Nickel prices rose 28% from the year before to $24 454/t. Vale's capital expenditures in the fourth-quarter totaled $1.8-billion, including growth and maintenance investments, roughly stable from a year earlier. In a statement, Vale's CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo said that on operations, the company took "concrete actions to deliver on our long-term growth guidance." The company's expanded net debt rose $856-million from the third quarter to $14.1-billion.
