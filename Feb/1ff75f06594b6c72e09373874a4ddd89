Diversified miner Anglo American has appointed Magali Anderson nonexecutive director and a member of its board sustainability committee, effective April 1. She is currently building materials company Holcim Group’s chief sustainability and innovation officer and a member of Holcim’s executive committee. Prior to joining Holcim in 2016 to lead safety and health, Anderson, a mechanical engineer, had spent the majority of her career in the oil and gas industry in a number of operational, commercial and business transformation leadership roles. Anglo chairperson Stuart Chambers says Anderson brings highly relevant experience from her career in capital-intensive industries and a deep understanding of sustainability in its broadest sense. “As a champion for responsible business practices and the opportunities for innovation to solve the greatest sustainability challenges, we look forward to welcoming Magali to the board,” he comments. Anderson also serves on the advisory boards of Business for Nature, the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium, the World Green Building Council and the 50L Home Coalition on water efficiency.
