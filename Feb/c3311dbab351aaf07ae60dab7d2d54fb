Completed in January, the newly renovated and extended Steenbok Clinic, in Steenbok, Mpumalanga, was recently opened to the public following a partnership to renew it by JSE-listed industrial minerals, bulk commodities and construction materials miner Afrimat, the Mpumalanga Health Department and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. Afrimatâ€™s Nkomati Anthracite mine, in Mpumalanga, officiated the opening of the clinic, having spent R3.8-million to fund the construction of an additional wing and a full facility upgrade of the clinic. The Steenbok Clinic offers primary healthcare to Steenbok residents and surrounding communities and the necessary upgrades form part of local economic development projects committed to by Afrimat Nkomati Anthracite to address fundamental needs identified specifically by the community. Tsobanang Construction, a local contractor, was appointed as the main contractor for the project and Caru Project Management managed the project, while local subcontractors were also afforded the opportunity to provide services for the project. To ensure local labour got the opportunity to work on the project, 22 people were hired from the local community. Other local economic development projects, totalling R8-million, include the construction of the Mawewe Community Hall, in Madadeni, which was completed in July 2022 and the construction of the Skhwahlane Community Hall in Skhwahlane, which is expected to be completed in May. Both community centres will serve as venues for training and development initiatives, traditional events and formal community meetings. Stakeholders who attended the event included the Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini, Nkomazi executive mayor Councillor Phindile Magagula, Nkomazi provincial speaker Councillor Hilda Nyambi and Kwa-Lugedlane Traditional Council inkosi Sizwe Ngomane.
