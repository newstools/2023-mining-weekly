Canadian miner Kinross Gold on Monday announced an initial mineral resource estimate (MRE) for its Great Bear project, in Ontario, marking an “exciting milestone” for the company. The resource consists of 2.74-million ounces of indicated resources with a grade of 2.57 g/t and 2.29-million ounces of inferred resources with 3.56 g/t grade. “In just one year since acquiring the property, we have validated our belief for this to potentially become a world-class asset. The initial MRE and continuity of high grades and widths at depth reinforces our vision for a high-quality openpit and sizeable underground mine,” said Kinross president and CEO Paul Rollinson. “We believe the resource we have defined today is just the beginning,” he added. The drill result of the resource supports Kinross’s hypothesis that the deposit remains open at depth with high grade and visible gold intercepted down to depths of one kilometre. Kinross’s focus for 2022 was drilling the first 500 m at the LP Fault zone to increase confidence in the upper portion of the deposit and facilitate the delivery of the initial mineral resource. The company drilled more than 250 km in 2022, including 225 km diamond exploration drilling. Combined with the drilling completed by Great Bear since 2018, a total of more than 550 km of drilling has now been completed on the property.
