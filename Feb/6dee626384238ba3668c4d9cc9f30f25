PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) has issued compliance directives to mine operators in Queensland following a series of serious incidents at Central Queensland coal mines involving mobile equipment operating on coal stockpiles. The directives follow three recently reported incidents in Queensland where mobile equipment being operated by workers sunk into voids that developed in stockpiles. The independent regulator’s directives require operators to take action to ensure risk to workers is managed to an acceptable level. Resources Minister Scott Stewart welcomed RSHQ putting the industry on notice about hazards involved with operating mobile equipment on stockpiles. “The health and safety of all workers is paramount for government. Regardless of the industry every worker deserves to come home safely from their job.” Stewart also welcomed the regulator’s on-going focus to ensure operations involving heavy mobile equipment are conducted in a way that does not expose workers to an unacceptable level of risk, including issuing a safety bulletin. RSHQ CEO Mark Stone said the action taken by the mines inspectorate was consistent with the regulator’s compliance and enforcement policy, combining education and corrective action. “The compliance directives issued by the inspectorate require mine sites to take action within a specified timeframe,” Stone said. “I expect for many operations, responding to the directive will validate that their safety systems are good. For some, the directive will help expose deficiencies and lead to improved risk control and learnings.”
