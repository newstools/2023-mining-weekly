PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Search and rescue efforts at the Dugald River zinc miner, in Queensland, were ongoing after two contract miners went unaccounted for following an incident at the mine. Contractor Perenti said its subsidiary Barminco was working closely with miner MMG and the relevant authorities to progress the rescue. The rescue team has employed the use of drones, void scanning technology and video imagery and this has enabled them to locate the light vehicle that the two missing employees were driving. The team has been working throughout the night, including with the use of heavy underground mining equipment, to gain access to the vehicle. Perenti MD and CEO Mark Norwell said the highly skilled mine rescue team is focused on executing the rescue operation as quickly and safely as possible. “While the situation is still evolving, we are in contact with the family members of our missing team members and Perenti is providing support to their colleagues and rescue team. “Everyone at Perenti is feeling the impact of this incident and whilst we hold deep concerns for the safety of our colleagues, we continue to be hopeful that a positive outcome can be achieved.”
