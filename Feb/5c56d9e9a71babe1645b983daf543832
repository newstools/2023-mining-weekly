PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Santos has resumed production at the John Brookes platform, offshore Western Australia, with the company saying ramp-up to full rates is expected in the coming days. Santos in late November last year temporarily shut down the platform after identifying a leak in the main gas trunkline connecting John Brookes to the Varanus Island gas processing facilities. Operations at Varanus Island continued at reduced rates and no changes to Santos’ production guidance had been anticipated. Repairs had initially been estimated at between four to six weeks. Santos MD and CEO Kevin Gallagher said on Thursday that he appreciated the work of Santos’ employees and contractors in returning John Brookes to production in a safe and efficient manner and without harm to the environment.
