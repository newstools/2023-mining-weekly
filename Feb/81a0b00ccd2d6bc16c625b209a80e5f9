Copper/silver miner Khoemacau Copper Mining reports that its Khoemacau mine, in Botswana, successfully ramped up its mining and processing volumes to 3.65-million tonnes a year in December. “We are delighted and extremely proud to have ramped up to full production during December 2022, with mining and processing operations continuing to operate at nameplate throughout January and all key operating and cost parameters in line with expectations. “This is an incredible achievement given the inflationary environment we have been operating in. “We have only reached this important milestone thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the Khoemacau team, our business partners and in-country stakeholders, who jointly stewarded the construction and successful commissioning of the mine on time and on budget against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic,” comments Khoemacau Copper Mining CEO Johan Ferreira. This announcement follows the company’s prior announcements regarding the completion of construction and commissioning activities on February 16, 2022 and the production of first copper silver concentrate on June 30, 2021.
