JAKARTA - Nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia broke ground on a 37.5-trillion rupiah ($2.48-billion) ferronickel smelter Sulawesi island on Friday, an Indonesian senior minister said. The Bahodopi project will produce ferronickel with 73 000 t to 80 000 t of nickel content per year, Vale has said. "I hope this will be followed by the laying of the next stones. God willing, it can be completed in 2.5 years," Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement.
