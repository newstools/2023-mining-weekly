Importantly, for the community, the VPA will ensure that come final investment decision on the Narrabri gas project, the redevelopment of the Narrabri Airport Terminal, works on the Narrabri Tourism and Cultural Precinct, Narrabri CBD master plan upgrades, Narrabri Library relocation, and Country Universities Centre expansion, will go ahead.” The Narrabri gas project has the potential to supply enough natural gas to meet up to half of New South Wales’ natural gas demand where more than one-million family homes, 33 000 businesses and 300 000 jobs rely on natural gas as a source of energy.
