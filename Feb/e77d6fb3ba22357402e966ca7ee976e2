PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner New Hope on Thursday said that work is under way to resume mining operations at the New Acland project, in Queensland, as all primary approvals for the New Acland Stage 3 project are in place. New Hope was in October last year granted the associated water licence for the New Acland Stage 3 development, marking the final primary approval requirement to enable the restart of mining operations at the New Acland mine. In its quarterly results for the three months to January, New Hope noted that planning had begun for the infrastructure works, including roads, dams and mining access required for the two new mining areas. Refurbishment of existing heavy mobile equipment and the wash plant had also begun. First mining is on track for late 2023, and first coal shipment is still expected in quarter one of 2024. An assessment centre was held at the Oakey RSL Club in January to accelerate the recruitment process for production and maintenance roles required as part of the operations ramp-up plan. By mid-March 2023, there will be over 100 locally based employees working at New Acland, the company said. The Stage 3 expansion project will increase the mine’s yearly output from 4.8-million tonnes to 7.5-million tonnes and will extend the operation’s life by 12 years. New Hope on Thursday reported a 7.2% fall in total run-of-mine production for the January quarter, compared with the quarter ended October, with production reaching just over 2-million tonnes. Saleable coal production was also down 5.1% in the same period to 1.5-million tonnes while coal sales declined by 22.3% to 1.46-million tonnes.
