Zambia's Mopani Copper Mines has suspended operations at one of its shafts in Kitwe, more than 350 km north of the capital Lusaka, following an accident which led to a worker dying, it said on Tuesday. "The incident happened at (the) 3 360 feet level as a team of contractor employees were allegedly loading sludge into a stationary underground rail wagon. One contractor employee sustained fatal injuries in the process," it said in a statement, adding the circumstances surrounding the accident were still uncertain. Operations at the South Ore Body Shaft were suspended for investigations by government authorities, the company said.
