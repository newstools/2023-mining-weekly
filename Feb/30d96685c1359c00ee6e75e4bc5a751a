Spain-focused mining and development company Atalaya Mining has announced that it will delist from the Toronto exchange on March 7, stating that the minimal trading volumes on the TSX do not justify the financial costs and administrative requirements associated with maintaining the listing. The company’s shares will continue to trade on the Aim market of the LSE. Atalaya explains that, over the past three years, daily trading activity in the company's ordinary shares on Aim  has increased materially and, in the last 12 months, has accounted for around 99% of the aggregate trading volume on both platforms.
