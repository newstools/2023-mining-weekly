PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Jupiter Mines on Monday announced that its 49.9%-held Tshipi é Ntle Manganese Mining has declared a R750-million final dividend to its shareholders for the second half of the current financial year, ending February 28. Jupiter will receive its share of this dividend, equating to R356-million or A$29-million, and will also receive R25-million, (or A$2-million) in marketing profits for the period, in addition to the dividend from Tshipi.

“We are very pleased at the size of this dividend, which again underscores the quality of Tshipi’s resource endowment and the capabilities of Tshipi’s management team. Since listing in April 2018, Tshipi’s strong dividend payment performance has enabled Jupiter to pay A$348-million in dividends to its shareholders,” said Jupiter MD Brad Rogers. “This is an outstanding achievement, particularly noting Tshipi’s resource life of more than 100 years remaining at current production rates.”
