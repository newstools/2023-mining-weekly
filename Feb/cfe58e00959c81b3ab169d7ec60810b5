Australian company Jindalee Resources on Monday announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the McDermitt lithium project, which is now the biggest deposit in the US. McDermitt’s combined indicated and inferred mineral resource inventory increased to three-billion tonnes at 1 340 ppm lithium for a total of 21.5-million tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) at 1 000 ppm cutoff grade. At 21.5-million tonnes LCE, McDermitt, in Oregon, is now the biggest lithium deposit in the US by contained lithium in mineral resource. By comparison, the Thacker Pass lithium project, in Nevada, has a total measured and indicated resource of 16.07-million tonnes LCE, according to Lithium America’s website. Jindalee said the 2023 combined indicated and inferred mineral resource update represented an overall increase in tonnage of 65%, with a 2% decrease in grade for a 62% increase in contained lithium. The indicated mineral resource increased by 138% in tonnage with an overall 131% increase in contained metal.
