Gemstone miner Gemfields has evacuated operational employees and contractors from its 75%-owned Nairoto Resources exploration camp following an insurgent attack in the village of Nairoto in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique. The village of Nairoto lies about 15 km southwest of the Nairoto camp and about 83 km north of Montepuez Ruby Mining (MRM), in which Gemfields also owns 75%. The attack occurred shortly before midnight on February 12. As a consequence, operations at the Nairoto Resources site have ceased, while there is no present impact on operations at MRM. “Gemfields, MRM and Nairoto Resources hold the health and safety of their employees and contractors as their highest priority and remain in regular contact with government authorities,” Gemfields says.
