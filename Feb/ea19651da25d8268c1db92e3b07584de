State-owned Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) has reported a steady improvement in operations that support the mining industry, following flooding and industrial action that adversely impacted on operations. TPT said on February 8 that the improvement was starting to reach, and in some instances exceed, the pre-Covid-19 numbers of the financial year that ended in 2018, one of TPT’s best-performing years. The company said it handled 257% more coal and 20% more manganese this financial year, compared with the 2017/18 financial year. Coal volumes have grown by 160% and manganese by 4% year-on-year. In addition, efficiencies in the handling rates for all bulk sector commodity segments – namely iron-ore, manganese, chrome, magnetite and coal – have improved. According to TPT commercial and planning GM Michelle van Buren Schele, this performance spells a new era for TPT. TPT has identified its key bulk commodity segments which include manganese, iron-ore, magnetite, chrome and coal. “This is where we are focused on increasing volumes and efficiencies, with the intention to make our customers competitive,” Van Buren Schele said. She added that global demand required maximum use of existing capacity, a much-needed opportunity in a struggling regional economy. TPT acknowledged that there was still room for improvement and said it was collaborating with its customers and other stakeholders to improve its service offering.
