Eskom has implemented continuous Stage 6 until further notice after eight generating units broke down on Sunday. "Given the high number of breakdowns, there is a possibility of further changes on the stages of load shedding at short notice," the power utility said. The breakdowns currently amount to 21 243 MW of generating capacity. Since Sunday afternoon a generating unit each at Arnot, Hendrina, Lethabo and Majuba, as well as two units at Camden Power Station suffered breakdowns and were taken offline for repairs. "Further, two generating units at the Lethabo Power Station were shut down due to coal constraints as the New Vaal Mine that is supplying the station has been unable to deliver the expected amount of coal during the past week because of the heavy rains. "The three running units are operating at minimum capacity and are at risk of shutdown should the coal supply constraints not be resolved."
