PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Office of Hydrogen Power South Australia was continuing with its request for proposals (RfP) process for the Whyalla green hydrogen project, with the process expected to close on March 14. The state government has set aside A$595-million to build a hydrogen power station, electrolyser and storage facility by December 2025, with the project to include 250 MWe of electrolysers, 200 MW of power generation and hydrogen storage. The government is hoping that the successful delivery of the project will help to unlock a pipeline of renewable energy developments in the region, and will catalyse other hydrogen projects in development, including those focused on hydrogen exports. Furthermore, the green hydrogen power plant will provide 'firming services' to renewable generation facilities, a process of maintaining electricity production from an intermittent power source such as wind or solar for a guaranteed period of time, thereby ensuring consistent output of supply. The RfP process is calling for industry partners to help develop the Whyalla project, and focuses on the supply, construction and operation of the hydrogen plant and equipment as well as seeking interest in purchasing green hydrogen produced at the facility. The Office of Hydrogen Power South Australia has noted that international interest in the project has been high, with more than 200 organisations engaging in the RfP process since it opened.
