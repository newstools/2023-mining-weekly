PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Azure Minerals has reported a 28% increase in the mineral resource estimate (MRE) at its Andover nickel project, in Western Australia. Azure on Wednesday reported a maiden MRE of 1.3-million tonnes, at 1.11% nickel, 0.46% copper and 0.05% cobalt for 14 700 t of contained nickel, 6 100 t of contained copper and 640 t of contained cobalt at the Ridgeline deposit. This has increased the total MRE for the Andover project to 6-million tonnes, at 1.11% nickel, 47% copper and 0.05% cobalt for 97 300 t of contained metal. Azure MD Tony Rovira said that the maiden resource for Ridgeline demonstrated that there continued to be excellent potential to significantly expand the resource base at Andover through ongoing exploration. “Ridgeline is blind to surface, which increased the challenge of identifying and defining the mineralisation. Given the technical understanding and knowledge that our team has built up through systematic exploration of the project area, I am confident that the team can deliver more discoveries,” he added. “Azure is in an excellent position to continue to explore and realise the nickel potential of the Andover project and I look forward to providing further updates as we progress.”
