CSE- and FSE-listed Pasinex Resources has temporarily halted operations at the Pinargozu zinc mine, in Türkiye, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its employees. CFO Andrew Gottwald said in a statement on Tuesday that the mine was not damaged by the devastating earthquakes that have struck the country, but noted that it was an integral part of the local community. “Our Adana offices and Pinargozu mine have not sustained any significant damage yet our priority remains the safety of our employees and the well-being of the local community. As a result, Pasinex has temporarily halted operations at the mine and will continue to monitor the situation and support the local community in any way possible.” The mine rescue team from Pinargozu, along with excavators and trucks, has been made available to the authorities to aid in the recovery efforts of nearby towns and cities. “We understand the impact that natural disasters can have on communities and are committed to being there for those in need during these challenging times.” Meanwhile, TSX-listed Global Atomic confirmed that based on initial reports joint venture zinc recycling operation employees have been contacted and are physically unharmed. The plant appears to have received only minor damage due to this week's earthquake. At the time of the earthquake, the zinc operation was under a scheduled maintenance shutdown. As communications and power are restored in the region, a thorough assessment of the plant will be conducted. "We extend our sympathies and condolences to all those affected by this event. The plant was a new build in 2019 and built to modern standards, which include preventive engineering and construction methods employed in earthquake regions. The impact of this earthquake in the region was extensive and we will provide further updates as more information is known," said president and CEO Stephen Roman.
