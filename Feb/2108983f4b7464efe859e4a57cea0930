US-headquartered Freeport-McMoRan has suspended operations at its Grasberg mine, in Indonesia, after intense rainfall resulted in flooding and a flow of debris, damaging infrastructure near its milling complex. Freeport is conducting a damage assessment and preparing a plan to resume operations, the company stated on Monday, noting that preliminary estimates indicate that operations could be restored by the end of the month. Grasberg produces nearly five-million pounds a day of copper and 5 000 oz/d of gold. As a result of the disruption in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan warned that its first-quarter sales would be lower than its guidance of 900-million pounds of copper and 300 000 oz of gold. Personnel were safely evacuated from the localised area. Grasberg is in the remote highlands of the Sudirman mountain range in the province of Papua, which is on the western half of the island of New Guinea.
