MADRID - The Spanish Energy Ministry has upheld its refusal to authorise the construction of a uranium mine near the western city of Salamanca by London-listed Berkeley Energia, which had appealed an earlier rejection, the company said on Tuesday. Berkeley said in a statement it was prepared to collaborate with Spanish authorities and remained hopeful the dispute could be resolved amicably through negotiations. It had appealed against the initial rejection claiming the government had not followed "legally established procedure".
