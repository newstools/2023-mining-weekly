PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths miner Vital Metals has announced the immediate resignation of nonexecutive chairperson Evan Cranston, who has served in the role since 2020. “Vital has had its ups and downs over the past few years. With the recent addition of Lionhead Resources as a shareholder and John Dorward as managing director comes the time for me to hand the reins over to the new team to implement the strategy of bringing forward production from what I believe is a world-class rare earth project at Tardiff,” said Cranston on Wednesday. “I have enjoyed working with Vital and look forward to following the company’s progress as it realises its full potential to be a leader in the North American magnet supply chain. I wish all involved the very best for the future and intend to remain a supportive shareholder as the company realises its true value.” Current nonexecutive director Richard Crookes has been appointed as interim nonexecutive chairperson until the company appoints a permanent replacement.
