Mining and exploration company Tertiary Minerals’ Konkola West copper project, in Zambia, has been brought into sharp focus by the recent $150-million investment in the adjacent Mingomba copper deposit – the Lubambe extension project. This investment was made by battery metals company KoBold Metals, whose shareholders include climate and technology fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which was founded by technology company Microsoft founder Bill Gates and backed by online retailer Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, diversified company Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson, as well as mining major BHP, as announced at the 2022 African Leader’s Summit hosted by US President Joe Biden administration. Tertiary has, therefore, announced the release of a separate Project Focus presentation on its website. The presentation now released for Konkola West Project is one of a number of such presentations planned for the company’s key exploration projects over the coming weeks Konkola West, one of five copper projects in Zambia where Tertiary has an interest, is targeting deep down-dip extensions of the contiguous Musoshi-Lubambe-Mingomba-Konkola copper deposits, which host the Musoshi mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the Lubambe mine and Konkola mines, and their respective concentrators, in Zambia. Together these deposits define a continuous zone of mineralisation more than 15 km long with a pre-mining endowment of more than 775-million tonnes graded at 2% to 3% copper. Konkola West is located about 2 km southwest of the Mingomba deposit, which currently has a resource of 250-million tonnes at 3.8% copper. Tertiary’s interests in Zambia also include the Jacks copper project, where the company completed soil sampling and drilling in 2022, along with the Mukai and Mushima North project areas, where the company is working with exploration company First Quantum Minerals to evaluate historical data and generate new exploration targets for evaluation this year.
