PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Core Lithium on Monday announced plans to relocate its corporate head office from Adelaide to Perth. The company told shareholders that in line with its transition to lithium producer, the decision was taken to relocate its head office to Perth, which is the corporate centre of Australia’s lithium industry, and would provide the company with better access to mining services providers, particularly those with lithium industry experience. The company said that Perth would also provide a pool of mining and project delivery talent, while retaining a direct and regular route to the Finniss lithium project in the Northern Territory. Core at the end of December loaded its first shipment of direct shipping ore from the Finniss project to a buyer in China. “Perth has become Australia’s lithium hub and hosts one of the nation’s largest mining talent pools. Relocating the corporate head office to Perth makes sense for Core and forms part of our broader strategy to build a sustainable, value-driven lithium business,” said CEO Gareth Manderson. Establishment of a Perth office is anticipated to occur by mid-2023 and closure of the Adelaide office is expected to be concluded by the end of 2023. Core has offered all Adelaide-based employees the option to relocate to Perth. Meanwhile, the company on Monday also announced the appointment of Melissa Winks as executive GM for sustainability and the appointment of Andrew Foreman as interim CFO. The company is still hunting for a permanent Perth-based CFO.
