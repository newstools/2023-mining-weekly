PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Calidus Resources has declared commercial production at its Warrawoona gold project, in Western Australia. The company told shareholders on Tuesday that the processing plant was now operating at nameplate capacity, with the project averaging 235 oz/d for the last third of December. Estimated unaudited cash costs for December were A$2 050/oz. “We are very pleased to have achieved commercial production and positive cashflow from the operations for the month. This is a credit to the whole team at Warrawoona,” said Calidus MD Dave Reeves. “We are now focussing on fine-tuning operations to increase throughput rates and production and we look forward to releasing guidance later this month.” Warrawoona is expected to produce up to 105 000 oz/y of gold, but could potentially produce up to 139 000 oz/y when the nearby Blue Spec deposit is developed.
