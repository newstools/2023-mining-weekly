PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has been awarded International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) certification for its occupational health and safety and its environmental management systems. The company said on Thursday that the ISO certifications were awarded following audits of Resolute’s management system and standards at the company’s corporate offices in Perth and London, as well as its Syama gold mine in Mali and the Mako gold mine in Senegal. “I am very pleased that this element, being one of our major platforms supporting our group’s strategy to become ‘industry leaders in environmental, social and governance (ESG), as we formally pledged to all stakeholders in our 2020 annual reports, has been formally certified by the distinguished Bureau Veritas. This industry-wide recognition is a significant demonstration of our commitment to our ongoing journey of continuous improvement,” said Resolute CEO Terry Holohan. “I look forward to be able to advise over the coming months on the progress of our other major ESG elements as they achieve their planned significant milestones.”
