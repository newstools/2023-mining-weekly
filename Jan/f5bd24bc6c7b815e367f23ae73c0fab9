Aim-listed Andrada Mining – previously AfriTin Mining – has managed to produce 8.2% less combined Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas emissions from its Uis tin mine, in Namibia, than what is stated in the Equator Principles Yearly Threshold. The company produced 8 208 t of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, or 0.018 t of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per tonne of ore processed, in the financial yar ended February 28, 2022. Further, the mine abstracted water from non-potable groundwater and surface water through a historical mining pit at a water-use intensity of 0.33 m3/t of ore processed. As of January 26, when Andrada released its Sustainability Report for the 2022 financial year, the Uis mine employed 315 people, of which 128 were permanent staff. The company highlights in the report that 75% of senior managers at the Uis mine are women and that the company spent just under half of its expenditure, or $6.8-million, on procuring goods and services from 250 Namibian suppliers. Although the company recorded no Level 5 or 4 environmental incidents, which are the most severe, it did record two Level 3 environmental incidents, which extended beyond the border of the mine site. Level 2 and 1 environmental incidents totalled 39 and 34, respectively, and involve minimal to material impacts with short-term durations. From March 2021 to February 2022, the Uis mine consumed a total of 58 733 GJ, equating to an efficiency of 0.13 GJ/t of ore processed. The company is committed to investing in renewable and lower-carbon energy solutions. CEO Anthony Viljoen says the company remains committed to improving its environment, social and governance credentials, as it has done over the 2021 to 2022 financial years.
