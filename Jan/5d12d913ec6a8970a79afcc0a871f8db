The mining industry has seen its fair share of highs and lows over the past ten years, with 2022 being no exception, but 2023 holds more positive headwinds. Engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) company Erudite CEO Johann de Bruin says last year was a turbulent year for the mining industry in South Africa, with persistent energy supply issues, higher-than-usual rainfall, global supply chain disruptions and a volatile commodities market. However, there remains an unwavering momentum in the battery material commodities, including graphite, lithium, nickel and cobalt. De Bruin predicts that this year and next will see a stabilised rand:dollar exchange rate. The rand was 8.47% weaker year-on-year against the dollar in December 2022. While a weaker rand is less than ideal for the average consumer, it is beneficial for exporters. “Local goods and commodities become less expensive for our international trading partners to acquire in comparison to competing markets, while the rand value for exporters is higher, which means that producers receive more for the same goods,” De Bruin explains. He also anticipates that countries will continue to find ways to adjust to the disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lingering tail of Covid-19 in the East, which De Bruin believes will plague the industry throughout 2023.
