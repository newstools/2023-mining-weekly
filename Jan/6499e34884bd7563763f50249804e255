PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Talga Group has inked a non-binding letter of intent (LoI) with electric vehicle battery manufacturer Verkor SA for the supply of graphite anode from Talga’s Vittangi project, in Sweden. Talga said on Wednesday that the LoI followed the successful qualification testwork of its Talnode-C product and formalised commercial discussions under way between the two companies. The LoI sets out non-binding terms for Talga to supply Verkor with Talnode-C for electric vehicle applications over a four- to eight-year period, with the companies working towards executing a binding term sheet in the first quarter of this year, along with advancing product qualification programmes. Talga’s Vittangi project will use 100% renewable electricity to extract graphite, a European Union-defined critical material, and refine it into coated anode for lithium-ion batteries. The first stage of the project will produce 19 500 t/y of anode for 24 years from the integrated mine-to-anode operation.
