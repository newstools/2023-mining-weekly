PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore major Fortescue has announced the resignation of group CFO Ian Wells. Wells joined the company in 2010 and has held various senior executive finance roles, including CFO since 2018. “Wells has made a huge contribution to Fortescue over what we will look back on as the formative years of Fortescue. Working closely with the board, Wells and the executive team have played an important role in the development and execution of our capital allocation framework together with supporting Fortescue’s differentiating culture and values,” said Fortescue executive chairperson and founder Dr Andrew Forrest. “Wells has been a trusted member of the executive team which has led Fortescue through a number of iron-ore market cycles, more recently the impacts of Covid-19 together with global volatility. Despite these challenges Fortescue has retained a reputation for consistent and predictable performance as well as operating and capital cost discipline.” Fortescue will now look for a successor for Wells, who will remain in the role of CFO until the end of January.
