PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed mining and development company Mineral Commodities has announced the resignation of MD and CEO Jacob Deysel, for personal reasons. Deysel will remain available in an advisory capacity, while CFO Adam Bick will assume the role of interim CEO, effective immediately. Bick joined MRC in 2017 and became CFO in 2019. “Deysel laid the foundation for MRC’s five year strategic plan and the recent rights issue that was strongly supported by shareholders. He has worked hard on fostering strong relationships with shareholders and regulators, with the company now well placed to build improved profitability in its heavy minerals business and increase the asset value of its battery minerals business,” said MRC chairperson Brian Moller. “The board is very grateful to Deysel and for his ongoing support and wishes him well in his future endeavours.”
