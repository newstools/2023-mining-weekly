Duncan Middlemiss has retired as president and CEO of gold producer Wesdome Gold Mines, having been with the company over the last six and a half years. Chairperson Warwick Morley-Jepson will act as interim president and CEO to manage the company as the board works with an executive search firm to select a permanent successor. To ensure an orderly succession, Middlemiss has agreed to remain in an advisory role to assist Morley-Jepson and the rest of the executive team on a temporary basis. “Through Duncan’s leadership, Wesdome has now brought its second core asset, the Kiena mine, into commercial production and is poised to transition its focus to scaling up its gold production in 2023 and beyond. We wish Duncan well in his future endeavors,” said Morley-Jepson. Morley-Jepson is a seasoned operator with significant experience in the global mining industry. He previously served as executive VP and COO of Ivanhoe Mines and of Kinross Gold. Prior to that, he held progressively more senior roles at gold mining companies with operations around the world. Morley-Jepson joined the Wesdome board in 2017 and has held the position of chair since 2019. Besides the Kiena mine, in Quebec, Wesdome also owns the underground Eagle River mine, in Ontario. The company also retains exposure to the Moss Lake gold deposit, in Ontario, through its equity position in Goldshore Resources.
