PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Abra base metals mine, in Western Australia, has produced its first concentrate just days after first ore was fed into the plant. “More great progress at Abra with first concentrate produced. Commissioning of the processing plant is progressing quickly and concentrate production shows initial process flow continuity,” said ASX-listed Galena Mining MD Tony James. “We will continue with the commissioning through January with the focus on achieving the plant’s processing design criteria and work towards first product shipment in the first quarter of 2023.” The 1.2-million-tonne-a-year Abra project will require a capital spend of A$170-million to develop, and will produce 95 000 t/y of lead and 805 000 oz of silver over a 16-year mine life.
