Tin miner Alphamin Resources, which owns and operates the Mpama North mine, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, produced a record 12 493 t of tin in 2022 – exceeding its guidance of 12 000 t. Underground mining performed particularly well, with both volumes and tin grades exceeding expectations. The processing plant achieved good recoveries at an average of 75%. A highly mineralised area underground, not previously included in the mineral resource or mine plan due to its structurally complex nature, was successfully mined and processed during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. This area delivered ore at good tin grades but contained high levels of sulphides, which impacted processing recoveries. Alphamin has again set its production guidance at about 12 000 t for this year. The company says it expects global tin supply to remain constrained over the next five years, while demand is likely to increase. "In light of these market fundamentals, the development of the Mpama South project and consequent planned production expansion to about 20 000 t/y of contained tin bodes well for future cash flow generation. The Mpama South project development remains on track for commissioning in December 2023," the company reports.
