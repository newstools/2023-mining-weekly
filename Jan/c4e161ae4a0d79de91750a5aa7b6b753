Seasoned mining executive Tony Makuch has been made permanent CEO of TSX-V-listed Discovery Silver, which is developing the Cordero project, in Mexico. He has been interim CEO of the company since June last year. Makuch is a professional engineer with more than 35 years of development, operational and leadership experience. Most recently he was CEO of Kirkland Lake Gold, a senior global gold company with operations in Ontario and Australia. During his five-year tenure, Makuch led the transformation of Kirkland Lake, increasing gold production from 315 000 oz/y to more than 1.4-million ounces a year and  its market capitalisation from C$1-billion to over C$10-billion. Discovery chairperson Murray John commented that Makuch was the right leader for the company. “His track record of success in optimizing the value of development projects and large-scale mining operations, along with his capital markets recognition, make him the right leader as we look forward to the imminent delivery of the prefeasibility study on our Cordero project.” Makuch commented that Cordero, in his view, was one of the most exciting large-scale development projects in the global mining industry. “I am highly motivated by the prospect of realising significant value for all stakeholders as we work to transform Cordero into a Tier 1 mine. The large volume of silver that Cordero is expected to produce and the excellent outlook for silver as a critical metal in the transition to green energy, also represents a compelling opportunity.” Discovery also announced the promotion of Roman Solis to VP Mexico. He has been with Discovery as country manager since 2018.
