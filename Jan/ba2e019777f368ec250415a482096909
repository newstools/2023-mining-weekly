Aim-listed Firering Strategic Minerals has announced the start of its large-scale Phase 2 soil sampling programme at its flagship Atex lithium/tantalum project, in Côte d'Ivoire. The Phase 2 programme is being undertaken in conjunction with Ricca Resources, following its $18.6-million investment to advance Atex to definitive feasibility study. Two new pegmatite zones have been identified – one on each side of the main strike. A total of 993, or 40%, soil samples have been taken out of a planned 2 491 samples. The number of soil samples prepared for analysis in Ghana is 673. Analysis will be done with portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and laser-induced breakdown spectrometry, which specifically targets the lithium in the samples. The first batch of prepared samples is expected to arrive in Accra this month. Mineral processing company Coremet has started coltan testwork in Johannesburg, South Africa, on three samples. The objective of the testwork is to determine the nature of the tantalum and niobium mineralisation within the samples, the particle size distribution of the said mineralisation, liberation and whether the mineralisation is amenable to upgrading and potential production of a tantalum/niobium concentrate. CE Yuval Cohen describes the finding of two new pegmatite zones and the mapping thereof during the soil sampling exercise as “particularly encouraging”. “Based on the current progress, we believe that our soil sampling programme will be completed ahead of time,” he states.
