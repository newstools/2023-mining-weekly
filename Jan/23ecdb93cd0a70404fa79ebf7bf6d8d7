PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Lake Resources has doubled the measured and indicated resource estimate at its Kachi lithium brine project, in Argentina, to 2.2-million tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent. Lake told shareholders on Wednesday that additional drilling upgraded and increased the confidence in the resource in the central area, with an inferred resource of 3.1-million tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent also present in the surrounding area defined over 117 km2. Lake recently reached a critical milestone at the Kachi demonstration plant, which has now been successfully operated by lithium extraction technology partner Lilac Solutions for 1 000 consecutive hours, producing 40 000 l of lithium chloride eluate.
