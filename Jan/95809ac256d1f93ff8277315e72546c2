The terms for Crocodile River tailings concentrate have been extended between Impala Platinum and Barplats Mine – subsidiaries of Impala Platinum Holdings (Implats) and Eastern Platinum (Eastplats), respectively. The terms were originally signed on September 29, 2020, for the delivery of platinum group metal (PGM) tailings concentrate to Impala. These terms will now apply until December 21 this year. “We are excited to continue to work with Impala on this project. We are targeting to restart the Zandfontein underground section to extract high-grade PGMs in 2023, which is already under an offtake agreement with Impala,” Eastplats CEO and President Wanjin Yang said in a January 25 update to shareholders. Eastplats owns, directly and indirectly, several PGM and chrome assets in South Africa. All of its properties are situated on the western and eastern limbs of the Bushveld Complex. Operations at the Crocodile River mine currently include remining and processing its tailings resource to produce PGM and chrome concentrates from the Barplats Zandfontein tailings dam.
