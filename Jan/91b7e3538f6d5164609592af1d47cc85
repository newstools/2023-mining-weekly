NYSE American-listed Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) has received $17.85-million from the US Department of Energy (DoE) for supplying 300 000 lb of US origin uranium concentrates at $59.50/lb to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The DoE awarded the contract to UEC last month, in response to the NNSA’s request for proposals to establish its strategic national uranium reserve programme. “We are honoured and delighted to have supplied 300 000 lb of US origin uranium concentrates to the NNSA and look forward to the continuation of the uranium reserve programme and working with the DoE in the coming years,” said CEO and president Amir Adnani. The NNSA last year issued a solicitation to purchase up to an estimated one-million pounds of domestically produced uranium, through up to four awards of 100 000 lb to 500 000 lb. Other suppliers who have won contracts include Energy Fuels and Peninsula Energy subsidiary Strata Energy.
