US miner Hecla has ratified a six-year agreement with workers belonging to the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 5114 at the Lucky Friday mine, in Idaho. The agreement leaves work rules largely unchanged from the prior agreement, while wages are increased to reflect inflationary pressures and to maintain Lucky Friday’s competitiveness in a tight labour market, the company states. “The agreement shows the strong working relationship with the USW Local 5114 and gives both the work force and Hecla stability,” comments president and CEO Phillips Baker. Lucky Friday is poised for its “best decade” in its 80-year history, Baker says, noting that its production in 2022 increased by 24%. Last week, Hecla reported silver production of 14.2-million ounces, which was its second highest and a 10% increase over last year, driven by dramatically higher output from Lucky Friday.
