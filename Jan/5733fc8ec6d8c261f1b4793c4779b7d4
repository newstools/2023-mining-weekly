Australia- and Toronto-listed Sarama Resources has discovered a new mineralised trend that extends for 700 m at the company’s Sanutura gold project, in Burkina Faso’s prolific Houndé belt. This follows the company undertaking 2 000 m of exploration aircore drilling last year within the Phantom, Phantom East and Phantom West prospects in the north of the Tankoro deposit at the project. The latest results mark the seventh discovery of additional and extensional mineralisation since the start of the company’s 50 000 m drill programme. Highlights from the latest discovery include a 20 m intersection of gold grading 1.68 g/t from 16 m downhole; 9 m of gold grading 2.14 g/t from 7 m downhole; and 5 m of gold grading 3.01 g/t from 43 m downhole. The new mineralised trend remains open in all directions beyond the 700 m strike length. Sarama says the mineralisation is oblique, with potential to link the Phantom and Phantom West trends over a 1 200 m strike length. The Sanutara project’s mineral resource currently stands at 600 000 oz of indicated and 2.3-million ounces of inferred resources. “We are excited that new, near-surface discoveries continue to be made throughout the Tankoro Mineralised Corridor, with the most recent results representing the seventh successive area where new mineralisation has been intersected outside the mineral resource. “This bodes well for the many other targets that have been identified for drilling. The identification of new cross-linking mineralisation is expected to add to the current mineral resource, which we plan to update after the completion of the current drill programme,” says CEO, MD and president Andrew Dinning.
