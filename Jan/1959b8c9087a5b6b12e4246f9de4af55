Diversified explorer and developer Galileo Resources reports that nine angled diamond drill holes, the assaying of which has been completed, at its Zambia-based Shinganda outcrop prospect, confirm a supergene copper/gold mineralised gossan zone containing malachite, chalcocite, native copper and associated gold mineralisation. With drilling totalling 1 227.2 m, prospecting at the option and joint venture project returned copper mineralisation over 50.3 m at a grade of 1.54% and gold mineralisation grading 0.30 g/t from 21 m in drill hole SHDD002. This includes 7 m at 4.36% copper and 1.51 g/t gold at a depth of 47 m. The nine-hole zone as defined thus far extends for about 200 m by 100 m in plan, and to between 70 m to 80 m deep, with a higher-grade core and lower grade margins. Galileo’s interest in the Shinganda area initially focussed on a historic angled drill hole completed in 1959, which reportedly cut a near-vertical zone of heavily veined sediments and copper oxides. Nine follow-up diamond drill holes were completed by the company in the second half of 2022. Drill hole SHDD004 returned 43.7 m of copper mineralisation at a grade of 1.01% and gold mineralisation of 0.18 g/t at a depth of 7.3 m. Drilling of hole SHDD005 revealed copper grading at 1.03% over 11 m and gold grading 0.55 g/t from 102 m, including a highly mineralised zone of 3.4 m that had copper grading at 2.89% and gold grading at 1.61 g/t, from 102 m. Galileo notes that primary chalcopyrite copper mineralisation encountered deeper in hole SHDD005 may represent the original sulphide source of the remobilised supergene mineralisation. Copper mineralisation of 0.72% over 16 m was found in drill hole SHDD006, along with gold grading 0.04 g/t from 11 m. Drilling towards the west-northwest and the east shows that mineralisation is not closed off in these directions. Chairperson and CEO Colin Bird says the Shinganda prospect is demonstrating significant potential as a copper/gold exploration project, with “very encouraging” intersection widths from drilling to date. Going forward, three-dimensional modelling of the deposit is proposed to assist in planning additional drilling, while further evaluation is continuing on other prospects within the exploration licence showing similar characteristics. “We are continuing to carry out pitting and trenching on additional nearby targets to demonstrate further potential within the licence area as we pursue our aim of drill testing several of these targets during the first half of 2023,” he says.
