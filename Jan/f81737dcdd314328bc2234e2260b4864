Mining multinational Anglo American has appointed Alison Atkinson projects and development group director and as a member of Anglo's group management committee, with effect from the second quarter of this year. Atkinson currently serves as AWE CEO, which is an arms-length body of the UK government responsible for developing and maintaining essential elements of the UK's nuclear deterrent, incorporating some of the world's most advanced research and production capabilities. "Alison's proven experience of leading large technology-based organisations delivering leading edge programmes and projects is ideally suited to the phasing and development of our portfolio of major growth options," says Anglo CE Duncan Wanblad. "By integrating our next phase of FutureSmart Mining technologies into those projects and our existing operations, we expect to see further improvements in safety and productivity, with enhanced project economics, while reducing our energy and water intensity. This new role is, therefore, also central to our attainment of our Sustainable Mining Plan climate targets and ambitions. We congratulate Alison on her appointment and look forward to welcoming her," he adds. "I am delighted to be joining Anglo American and to have the opportunity to shape the execution of a diverse pipeline of projects that offer growth of 25% over the next decade alone, helping improve the way we all live in balance with the world's natural resources and society," Atkinson comments. "Given the increasingly recognised role of many metals and minerals in decarbonising much of the global economy, it will be exciting to bring the latest science and engineering solutions together to ensure we can supply those essential materials in a climate-responsible way," she says.
