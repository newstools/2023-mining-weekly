State-owned power utility Eskom will implement Stage 6 loadshedding from 16:00 on January 11, until further notice. The entity cites severe capacity constraints as the reason behind the more prevalent planned blackouts, particularly since eleven generators totalling over 5 GW of capacity had broken down on January 10. The power stations affected by the breakdowns include Kriel, Kendal, Matla, Duvha, Camden, Hendrina and Majuba. Fortunately, six units have been returned to service since then, amounting to 2.5 GW of capacity. Meanwhile, there is also planned maintenance on 5.7 GW worth of units.
