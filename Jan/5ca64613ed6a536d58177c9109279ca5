The Supreme Court of British Columbia has appointed FTI Consulting Canada as receiver, without security, of the assets of the base metals firm Trevali’s Caribou mine. The embattled base metals miner in August suspended operations at Caribou and halted plans to expand its Rosh Pinah mine, in Namibia, after filing for protection from its creditors. In October, Trevali started a court-approved sales process of its interest Caribou and Rosh Pinah. Appian Natural Resources Fund III and Appian Natural Resources (UST) Fund III will buy Rosh Pinah. Meanwhile, Trevali announced that Steven Molnar has resigned as a director of Trevali Mining (Maritimes) and Trevali (NB), effective immediately. Steven Molnar will remain as the company's chief legal office.
