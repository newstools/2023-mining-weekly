Original-equipment manufacturer Epiroc has won a R200-million order for low-profiling mining equipment from diversified miner African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) for use at its Bokoni platinum mine, in Limpopo. ARM has ordered drill rigs, loaders and mine trucks from Epiroc. The mine is restarting after being on care and maintenance the past few years. “We are excited to, once again, provide equipment to the Bokoni platinum mine . . .  supporting ARM as they restart and operate the mine in the most productive and safe way possible,” Epiroc president and CEO Helena Hedblom said on January 24. The machines that were ordered are built with a low profile and are well-suited for the mine’s low tunnel heights. The equipment includes Boomer face-drilling rigs, Boltec and Cabletec rock-reinforcement rigs, Scooptram loaders and Minetruck haulers. All the machines will come standard with Epiroc’s Certiq telematics solution for automated monitoring of productivity and machine performance. Other advanced features include, for example, the Boomer machines being equipped with a pilot hydraulic control system that further improves drilling accuracy. Delivery of the equipment will begin during the first quarter of this year and will continue into next year.
