Trade union Uasa says it is continuing its battle against job losses at gold producer Pan African Resources’ Barberton Mines following the company’s notice of possible retrenchments and restructuring late last year. In December, the gold miner issued Uasa with a Section 189 notice, followed by meetings set by Barberton Mines to explain the justification behind the notice. While proceeding with the matter, the company proposed a full calendar operations (Fulco) working system for the affected divisions. The Fulco working system is expected to create more working opportunities in these divisions, while preventing the proposed 600 job cuts. Bilateral meetings between Uasa and management at Barberton Mines are ongoing, as they aim to negotiate the terms and conditions of the Fulco system to ensure a zero job loss position at the company. At the same time, the union continues the battle with diversified miner Sibanye-Stillwater’s Beatrix 4 Shaft and Kloof 1 plant, both part of the company’s gold division, to ensure that zero jobs are lost. This comes after the company also gave notice of possible retrenchments and restructuring late last year. Sibanye’s gold division – which includes Kloof, Driefontein, Burnstone and Platinum mines – has more available positions than the needed retrenchments, according to Uasa. “The fight is for all employees to be employed in all other Sibanye operations rather than to be retrenched,” the union said. “The economic challenges we all face are difficult for most of us. Uasa will work hard to ensure that the company considers all options and solutions and that no worker loses a job,” the union stated.
