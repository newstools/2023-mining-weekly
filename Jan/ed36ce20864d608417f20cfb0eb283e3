Diversified miner Teck Resources has missed its fourth-quarter steelmaking coal guidance of 5-million to 5.4-million tonnes, citing extreme weather in December. The mining company on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter steelmaking coal sales of 4.3-million tonnes and explained that cold weather across western Canada had negatively impacted on rail performance, rail car unloading and overall port performance. The firm also reported average realised steelmaking coal prices of $278/t in the fourth quarter, resulting in an expected provisional pricing adjustment of negative $10-million. Teck would report fourth-quarter results on February 21.
