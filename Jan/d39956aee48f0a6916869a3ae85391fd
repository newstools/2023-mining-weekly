PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has reported a 58% increase in the mineral resource estimate for its Syama North project, in Mali. Following positive exploration drilling, the project’s mineral resource now stands at 34-million tonnes grading 2.9 g/t gold for 3.18-million ounces. “The infill drilling programme at Syama over the second half of 2022 has exceeded our expectations and the drill rigs are still turning on this contiguous strike discovery of over 6 km. We now have 1.86-million ounces in the measured and indicated categories for 19-million tonnes at 3 g/t gold at a 1 g/t gold cut-off. This mineralisation is close to the surface and adjacent to the areas we are currently mining,” said Resolute CEO Terry Holohan. “Our previously mentioned ‘low-capex enhancement’ prefeasibility study, due for publication in the second quarter of 2023, will initially focus on the wide zone within the A21 pit discovered in August 2022. This is a result of the recent grid drilling, which demonstrates the presence of a substantial block of mineralisation which should have a lower strip ratio than initially thought. It also remains open below the 150 m depth limit drilled so far. “Our end of year mineral resource and ore reserve estimates will be published in February 2023, incorporating these significant additions to our business. I am extremely proud of the achievements of our exploration team and the ongoing success at Syama. Significant discoveries such as this clearly demonstrate that the Syama Belt is surprisingly under-explored and justifies the need for further systematic exploration work to be undertaken along the near 85 km of strike.”
