East African gold producer Caracal Gold reports that its nonexecutive chairperson Simon Thomas has resigned with immediate effect as of January 13. The miner notes that it is in “advanced discussions” with a potential replacement chairperson, who will be appointed in due course. Caracal has over 1.3-million ounces of Joint Ore Reserve’s Committee-compliant resources with its Kilimapesa gold mine, in Kenya, and its acquisition of the Nyakafuru gold project, in Tanzania. Meanwhile, the miner plans to provide a corporate update on its performance through the second half of 2022, on January 23 during its annual general meeting.
