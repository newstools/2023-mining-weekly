London-listed lithium developer Savannah Resources says the due diligence period for signing an option agreement with ASX-listed heavy mineral sands miner MRG Metals related to a mining concession in Mozambique has expired, with the parties mutually deciding not to proceed further. This follows after Savannah and MRG in November signed a binding heads of agreement for MRG to potentially acquire mining concession 9735C in Mozambique.
