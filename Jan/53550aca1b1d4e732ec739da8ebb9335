The Registrar of Companies in Guernsey, where technology metals mining company AfriTin Mining is registered, has confirmed the company’s name change to Andrada Mining. The change of name took effect on January 11 at 08:00, with dealings under the new company name having begun. The name Andrada reflects the company's expanding lithium and tantalum resources alongside its ongoing tin production. The new name originates from Brazilian mineralogist and professor José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva who first discovered petalite and spodumene, which are major lithium bearing minerals and a precursor to the identification of lithium. The company’s management believes that the Uis licence, in Namibia, could host a globally significant lithium resource. “I’m delighted to confirm the company’s change of name and we look forward to rebranding as Andrada Mining. The company’s potential lithium resource size in Namibia is . . . exciting, and the change of name reflects the importance of it within our growing production profile, beyond our existing tin operation. We look to the future . . . as Andrada Mining plays its part in the energy transition,” Andrada CEO Anthony Viljoen said.
