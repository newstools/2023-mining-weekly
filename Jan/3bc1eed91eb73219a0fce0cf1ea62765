Exploration company Emperor Metals has completed its first share payment of 1.5-million shares and a second cash payment of C$450 000 under its option agreement to acquire the Duparquet project, in Quebec. The company can acquire a mineral claim package comprising 38 claims, covering 1 389 ha, from Duparquet Assets – a 50% subsidiary of TSX-listed Globex Mining Enterprise. “We are excited to bring market attention to this unique opportunity to delineate resource extensions of this high-grade gold deposit in a tier-one mining district,” said Emperor CEO John Florek. Emperor will start a drilling programme in the second quarter of 2023, after coalescing and finalising the available geological databases, which span decades. The property hosts a historical inferred mineral resource estimate of 727 000 oz of gold at a grade of 5.42 g/t.
