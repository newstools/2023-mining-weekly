PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered 41 diamonds, including two specials weighing 15.27 ct and 12.37 ct, from a bulk sample at the Lulo kimberlite mine, in Angola. The bulk sample of 2 200 m3, or 5 641 t of kimberlite material, returned the 41 diamonds weighing a collective 66.05 ct, with 12 diamonds greater than 1 ct recovered. “We are delighted with the result and recovery of special sized diamonds from this Lulo kimberlite sample. The Lulo kimberlite exploration programme has delivered tangible proof that the Lulo kimberlite province hosts primary sources containing specials, confirming Lucapa’s and our partner’s long held views,” said Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall. “Preliminary indications are that the kimberlite deposit has a very coarse average stone size of 1.61 ct which compares very favourably to two of the coarsest primary source kimberlites globally, the Mothae and Letšeng mines in Lesotho.”
