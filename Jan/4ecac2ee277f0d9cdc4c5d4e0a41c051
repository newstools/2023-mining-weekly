PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Sayona Mining on Monday said it was on track to restart production at the North American Lithium (NAL) operation, in Quebec, during the first quarter of this year. The ASX-listed company told shareholders that progress towards the concentrator restart was nearly 90% complete by the end of December for engineering and construction, with all critical equipment received. Some 75% of electrical and mechanical inspections were also completed. “Sayona continues to advance towards the restart of production at NAL this quarter, and I congratulate the project team for pushing through the holiday period to ensure targets are met,” said Sayona MD Brett Lynch. “This is particularly noteworthy given widely publicised global supply chain issues and cost pressures, with our team working hard to mitigate any potential issues. We now plan on releasing bi-monthly updates on the NAL restart as we accelerate closer towards production. “With demand from North America’s electric vehicle and battery sector continuing to increase, NAL’s outlook is excellent, putting Québec in a highly strategic position as a clean and green, economical and stable supplier of this vital battery mineral.” An earlier prefeasibility study estimated that the 1.5-million-tonne-a-year NAL operation could deliver 4.4-million tonnes of spodumene concentrate over a mine life of 27 years. Sayona is targeting an expansion of NAL’s future mine production capacity following the recent acquisition of 48 new claims spanning nearly 2 000 ha, located adjacent to the NAL operation.
