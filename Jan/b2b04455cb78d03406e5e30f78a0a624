PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Explorer Jindalee Resources has completed the spin-out and initial public offering (IPO) of Dynamic Metals, with that company listing on the ASX. Dynamic, which raised A$7-million in its IPO process, hosts a portfolio that includes an extensive landholding in the Widgiemooltha district and the Lake Percy project, both of which are highly prospective for lithium, nickel and gold, as well as the Deep Well nickel/copper/platinum project in which Dynamic holds an 80% interest. The separation of Jindalee’s Australian assets into Dynamic Metals will leave the company as a pure-play US lithium company, focused on the development of its McDermitt lithium project in Oregon. Following the spin-out, Jindalee will hold 12.5-million shares in Dynamic, accounting for a 25.5% interest in the company, providing its shareholders with a continued interest in the Dynamic projects.
