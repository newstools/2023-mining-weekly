Metals exploration company Kavango Resources announces that drilling is about to restart at the company’s Kalahari Copper Belt (KCB) project area following a scheduled summer break. At hole KCBRD006, Kavango will restart drilling on the sixth and final hole in the current drilling programme on prospecting licence 082/2018 this weekend. Upon completion, the company expects to have drilled about 1 640 m in the programme, exceeding its original guidance. At KCBRD006, Kavango is targeting a major stratigraphic structure identified by its Controlled-Source Audio MagnetoTelluric (CSAMT) surveying. Kavango has interpreted the CSAMT data as indicating the presence of a D'Kar/Ngwako Pan horizon contact. This is the primary control for economic copper/silver mineralisation in the KCB. Kavango’s analysis identifies this as a continuation of the horizon hosting Sandfire Resources’ neighbouring Kronos copper target zone. Physical confirmation of the contact’s presence will validate the company’s use of CSAMT as a KCB exploration tool, it says. “Through our innovative use of CSAMT, Kavango has identified major structures for the first time on our KCB licences. Our ongoing drill programme has subsequently confirmed these to be associated with deformation, fluid flow and alteration. This could be a game changer in exploration for a new generation of drill targets on the KCB. “Given the large size of our KCB licence package, Kavango is currently working to optimise and prioritise these. Our COO Brett Grist is presently in Botswana with our senior consultants, the results of which work are expected to refine our 2023 KCB exploration strategy,” comments Kavango CEO Ben Turney.
