The Essakane mine, which is Iamgold’s biggest operation, has produced a record 432 000 oz in 2022, despite operational challenges because of supply chain issues in Burkina Faso. The mine exceeded the upper-end of the updated guidance range of 410 000 oz to 430 000 oz, as it benefited from higher grades in the year. Fourth-quarter attributable production was 98 000 oz, based on mill throughput of 2.8-million tonnes at a head grade of 1.35 g/t and gold recoveries of 89%. Mining activities were lower in the fourth quarter, owing to supply chain constraints related to the security environment in the country, which suffered a military coup on September 30. Iamgold chairperson, interim president and CEO Maryse Belanger says the safety and security of its employees in Burkina Faso remains its number-one priority. “The company continues to take proactive measures to ensure the safety and security of in-country personnel and is constantly adjusting our protocols and the activity levels at the site according to the security environment,” she comments. Meanwhile, the Rosebel mine in Suriname, which is being sold to Zijin for $360-million, reported its strongest quarter of the year, resulting from accessing higher grade zones. Annual attributable production was 214 000 oz and fourth-quarter production was 69 000 oz, based on total mill feed of 2.1-million tonnes at an average head grade of 1.29 t/t gold. Westwood, in Canada, produced 67 000 oz in the year and its fourth-quarter output was 18 000 oz. Overall, Iamgold produced 713 000 oz in the year, which is above its 650 000 oz to 705 000 oz guidance range. The miner expects its consolidated cash costs and consolidated all-in sustaining costs for its three operating mines to be near the lower end of its guidance ranges of between $1 100/oz and $1 130/oz and between $1 600/oz and $1 650/oz, respectively. Iamgold will release its fourth-quarter and full-year results, including its guidance for 2023 and an update on its Cote project, in Canada, on February 16.
