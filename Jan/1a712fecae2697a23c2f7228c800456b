LSE-listed diamond developer and miner Botswana Diamonds has completed construction of its Marsfontein alluvial project, in Limpopo, South Africa, and has started stripping of the overburden overlying the gravels. As such, MD James Campbell says production is imminent. He explains that the Marsfontein project is a precursor to the larger Thorny River project, which is expected to come on stream in the second quarter of this year. Further, Campbell reports that regulatory approval has been received to increase Botswana Diamond’s stake in the highly-prospective Botswana-based Maibwe joint venture. In addition, all resolutions were duly passed during Botswana Diamonds’ annual general meeting on January 19.
