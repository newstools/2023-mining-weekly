Exploration company Probe Gold will graduate to the TSX on January 27. The company previously traded on the TSX-V. Probe states that its graduation to the TSX is a testament to its corporate and project growth. “As our Novador project transitions to a development asset we will have additional opportunities that can be better accessed through the TSX platform. Our TSX listing will also provide a wider audience and enhanced capital markets exposure as we continue expanding,” the company says. The Novador project was formerly known as Val-d’Or East, in Quebec. Probe states that the Novador project is one of the most prospective gold exploration and development prospects in Canada, and the TSX listing, and name changes will assist in repositioning the company as a premier explorer and developer.
