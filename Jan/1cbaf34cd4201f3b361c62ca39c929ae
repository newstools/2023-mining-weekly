PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore commissioning has started with the Abra base metals mine, in Western Australia, with first ore feed reaching the plant this week. “With ore commissioning underway, we expect first concentrate production in January 2023 followed by the first product shipment in the first quarter of 2023 as previously announced. The mine now moves into the next phase of production ramp-up which will underpin the long-term performance and life of the Abra mine,” said Galena Mining MD Tony James. Practical completion of the processing plant was achieved ahead of schedule in December, and ore commissioning started this week, Galena told shareholders. The 1.2-million-tonne-a-year Abra project will require a capital spend of A$170-million to develop, and will produce 95 000 t/y of lead and 805 000 oz of silver over a 16-year mine life.
