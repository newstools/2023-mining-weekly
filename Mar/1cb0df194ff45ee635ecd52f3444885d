Canadian miner Centerra Gold on Monday announced the appointment of Paul Tomory as CEO, with effect from May 1. He is succeeding Paul Wright, who stepped in as interim president and CEO when Scot Perry resigned in September last year. Tomory has more than 25 years of experience in mining, engineering and construction. His most recent position was as executive VP and chief technical officer of Kinross Gold, where he worked for 14 years in a series of progressive technical roles. Prior to Kinross, he worked in management consulting at Bain & Company and in a technical capacity with Golder Associates. “We are delighted to have Paul lead Centerra at this important stage of the company’s journey. His leadership experience and record of strategically building and operating mines through all stages of the mining life cycle while ensuring a safety-first culture, will be extremely valuable to Centerra. He has a wealth of technical expertise that we believe will position the company for future growth, bringing development assets into production and optimising performance of Centerra’s existing assets,” said chairperson Michael Parrett. Parrett also thanked Wright for his impactful leadership as interim president and CEO. “In his short tenure, Paul has been instrumental in several areas including in furtherance of a restart of operations at the Öksüt mine, as well as initiating a restructuring of the company’s head office, to name a few. We look forward to his continued insight, input and leadership on the board of directors.”
