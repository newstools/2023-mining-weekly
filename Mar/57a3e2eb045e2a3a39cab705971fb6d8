The Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, the World Economic Forum and The Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development on Monday co-hosted the eighth yearly International Mines Ministers Summit (IMMS) at the PDAC 2023 Convention. The summit brings together Ministers responsible for mineral exploration and mining from around the world, along with representatives from industry and civil society, providing an important setting to discuss challenges and opportunities affecting mineral exploration and development around the globe. The 2023 summit focused on the concept of circular economies and how the mineral industry could fill gaps in circularity. Discussions focused on how to balance rights and responsibilities of governments and industry in transitioning to a low-carbon future and how to bolster critical mineral production to drive this transition. Representatives from the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum, McCarthy Tétrault, the Canada-Africa Chamber of Business, MineAfrica, and the government of Canada joined TMX Group head of global mining Dean McPherson to close the market.
