PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Takeover target New Century Resources has suspended production at its namesake zinc mine, in Queensland, and at the Karumba port facility, following heavy rainfall in the region. The company on Thursday said that only critical dewatering and maintenance activities continued at the moment. Production will only restart once the weather improves and safe access to production areas could be re-established. “The safety and well-being of our employees and business partners remains paramount. No safety incidents have occurred, and core infrastructure remains secure, including the Century tailings storage facility, processing plant and pipeline, along with the Karumba Port Facility and the M.V.Wunma,” the company said in a statement. The miner this week urged shareholders to accept a A$1.10-a-share takeover offer from global metals miner Sibanya-Stillwater.
