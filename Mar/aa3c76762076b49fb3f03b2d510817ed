Anglo American's diamond mining business De Beers provisionally sold $495-million worth of rough diamonds through its global sightholder sales and auctions in its second sales cycle of 2023 – from February 20 to March 7. Although the latest figure remains subject to adjustment based on final completed sales, it reflects an increase from the $454-million of rough diamonds sold in the first sales cycle of the year, but a decrease from the $652-million sold in the second sales cycle of 2022. De Beers CEO Al Cook says there is continued steady demand for rough diamonds in line with De Beers’ expectations for sales as the year progresses. “For example, we know that sightholders planned more of their purchases for later in 2023, given the economic uncertainty at the time they were taking their planning decisions at the end of 2022. “It is also encouraging to see some positive trends in end-client demand for diamond jewellery at the start of the year,” he says.
