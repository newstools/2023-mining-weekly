Members of the International Copper Association (ICA) have laid plans to reach net zero in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, and to significantly reduce Scope 3 emissions, as a “strong first step” in a coordinated industry effort to realise sustainable, efficient and net-zero operations over the next three decades. Under the ‘Copper - The Pathway to Net Zero’ roadmap, ICA members will reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by between 30% and 40% by 2030 and between 70% and 80% by 2040. Regarding Scope 3 emissions, members will work with value chain partners to reduce emissions by 10% by 2030, 30% to 40% by 2040 and 60% to 70% by 2050. This would result in a collective emissions reduction of up to 85% by 2050. “Copper is the cornerstone material for a net-zero future, and our industry is committed to producing copper as sustainably as possible. Meeting this net-zero goal requires more than just investment; it requires partnerships across the entire value chain. ICA’s members are ready to collaborate and partner with all stakeholders to further improve industry sustainability and meet our 2050 goals,” said ICA president Anthony Lea. Refined copper production emitted an estimated 97-million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018. Scope 2 emissions accounted for 46% of these emissions, followed by Scope 3 at 31% and Scope 1 at 23%. This constitutes 2% of mining and metals sector emissions, and 0.2% of global man-made emissions. The roadmap builds on previous best practice guidelines by ICA, which represents some of the world’s biggest producers of refined copper. In 2020 with the support of ICA, The Copper Mark, an independent third-party assurance framework, was launched. The Copper Mark was designed to provide all stakeholders with the confidence that certified copper production sites operate according to internationally accepted, responsible industrial practices.
