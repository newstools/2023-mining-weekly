Precious metals and critical minerals miner Sibanye-Stillwater said on Monday the shaft accessing deeper levels of its Stillwater West mine, in Montana, had suffered structural damage following an “incident” that occurred during maintenance on the winder. The company explained that the shaft headgear, winder house and winder rope had been damaged during the incident and that it would suspend production below the 50 m level of the mine for about four weeks to allow for remedial work. This would result in about 25 000 oz of 2E to 30 000 oz of 2E oz less production for the year, Sibanye said, stating that it would provide further guidance once the shaft repairs had been finalised. Access to the upper levels (above 50 level) of the Stillwater West mine and the Stillwater East mine (through the east portal) are unaffected and production from these areas, as well as from the East Boulder mine, will continue. Sibanye noted that there were no injuries to personnel from this incident and that a probe was under way to determine the causes of the incident.
