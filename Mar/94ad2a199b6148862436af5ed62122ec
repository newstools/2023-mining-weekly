Gold miner Harmony Gold Mining says an employee was killed in a rigging-related incident at its Tshepong North mine, in the Free State, on March 7. “This loss of life is a tragedy for Harmony and indeed the mining industry at large. Having celebrated the safe start to the calendar year, these incidents remind us that we cannot ever be complacent, and that workplace safety is non-negotiable,” CEO Peter Steenkamp says. A comprehensive internal investigation into the incident is under way and the relevant authorities have been notified.
