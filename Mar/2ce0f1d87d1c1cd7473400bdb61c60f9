ASX-listed Australian Strategic Materials (ASM) on Monday appointed CEO Rowena Smith as MD. Chairperson Ian Gandel commented in a statement that it was a natural progression following Smith’s appointment as CEO in July. “Since Rowena became CEO last year, she has led the company through a successful capital raising, the commencement of the EPC definition work for the Dubbo project and the first sale and delivery of product from the Korean Metals plant. “These activities have placed ASM in a strong position for 2023, as we progress our Dubbo project and ramp-up of the Korean Metals plant,” said Gandel. Smith is a highly experienced global mining executive with over 30 years’ experience in various senior roles including strategy, commercial, operations and environmental, social and governance. Prior to joining ASM, she was South32’s chief sustainability officer and VP of supply, leading teams across Australia, South Africa, Mozambique, Colombia and the US. Smith has also held roles with Rio Tinto and BHP for Nickel West. ASM's Dubbo project, in New South Wales, contains light and heavy rare earths, zirconium, niobium and hafnium.
