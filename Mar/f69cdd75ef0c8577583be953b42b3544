PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Province Resources has appointed services firm GHD to undertake a prefeasibility study (PFS) for the downstream component of its HyEnergy hydrogen project, after taking back full ownership of the project. The HyEnergy project is a green hydrogen development in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia, with production facilities planned for construction near Carnarvon. Province on Tuesday reported that a term sheet inked with Total Eren Australia on the development of the HyEnergy project had expired without the companies signing a binding term sheet, as the two firms were not fully aligned on the objectives of the project. Instead, GHD has now been appointed following a tender process. The PFS scope will include water production, electrolysis, air separation for nitrogen production, ammonia synthesis and product storage, loading and export. It will also cover construction phase support facilities, including an accommodation camp, and marine import facilities. Marine import infrastructure includes a barge landing and a materials offloading facility. The downstream PFS is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year, while the award of the upstream PFS is expected soon. “Province is fully funded to undertake the PFS as well as the definitive feasibility study and we’re excited to get this work underway,” said Province MD David Frances. “While negotiations with native title groups, pastoralists and other stakeholders have taken longer than we hoped, we wanted to ensure they were done in a thorough and respectful manner. That has resulted in our strong position on land tenure. We are now well-placed to significantly increase the pace of this development.”
