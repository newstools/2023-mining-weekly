Project developer Artemis Gold is gearing up to start with major construction activities at the Blackwater mine, having received approval for its BC Mines Act permit. The company is targeting an initial gold pour from the 530 000 oz/y mine in the second half of 2024. The Blackwater mine is estimated to be the biggest gold mine development project in the Cariboo region of British Columbia in more than a decade, supporting regional employment over multiple decades with the potential to be extended through further exploration. Artemis chairperson and CEO Steven Dean noted that the mine had been designed to have one of the smallest carbon footprints for an openpit gold project in the world, with a defined path forward to substantially reducing that footprint further and potentially achieving net-zero carbon emissions through the integration of a zero-exhaust-emission haul fleet by 2029. Premier David Eby congratulated Artemis Gold, Lhoosk’uz Dené Nation, Ulkatcho First Nation, and Carrier Sekani First Nation, and communities in the area, for their work together to advance the project through the mine permitting and review process to final approval and construction. “The Blackwater Gold project will put lots of people to work and create a wide range of opportunities and benefits for local businesses, communities and First Nations while ensuring the highest standards of environmental protection, mitigation and sustainability,” said Eby. An economic impact study completed by KPMG on Blackwater in November 2020 anticipates the project will create 457 direct full-time jobs a year over the operating life of the mine and with 825 direct full-time jobs a year created during the construction/expansion phases of mine development. Further, the mine is expected to contribute C$13.2-billion to the provincial economy, over the life of the mine, including C$2.3-billion to provincial revenues.
