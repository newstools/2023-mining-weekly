Australia-listed Pursuit Minerals is on track to complete the acquisition of Trilogy Minerals, the owner of the Rio Grande Sur project, in Argentina, in the next two weeks, MD Bob Affleck said on Monday. The remaining due diligence items and documentation to complete the transaction are expected to be finalised this week, with completion scheduled to occur the following week. “Pursuit sees this transaction as being transformational for the company and looks forward to advancing the project with the Trilogy team,” Affleck commented. Pursuit announced the acquisition of Trilogy at the end of 2022. The Rio Grande Sur project covers 9 233 ha, with the project partially located within the Rio Grande Salar which hosts an inferred resource of 2.1-million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent at an average grade of 370 mg/lithium.
