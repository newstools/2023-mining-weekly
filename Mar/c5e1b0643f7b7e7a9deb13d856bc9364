Ontario has announced the recipients of the Critical Minerals Innovation Fund, which is supporting research for extraction and processing technologies to build critical minerals supply chain. Launched in November, the C$5-million forms part of Ontario’s Critical Minerals Strategy, which also earmarked C$24-million for the Ontario Junior Exploration Programme, of which C$12-million will be a critical minerals funding stream. The recipients of money from the innovation fund include: “The critical minerals sector continues to play a key role in Ontario’s end-to-end supply chain,” said Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade Minister Vic Fedeli, who announced the funding at the yearly Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention, in Toronto. “Through the Critical Minerals Innovation Fund, we’re connecting the critical minerals of the north with the manufacturing might of the south, increasing our competitive advantage and ensuring Ontario remains a global leader in the mining sector.”
