Canada-based Mandalay Resources on Monday announced Frazer Bourchier, the former CEO of Harte Gold and former COO of Detour Gold, as president and CEO, with effect from April 3. In the interim, current CEO Dominic Duffy will be working with Bourchier to support a smooth transition. Duffy will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director. "We are delighted to welcome Frazer to Mandalay as our new CEO. With his extensive industry knowledge, operational track record and deep understanding of capital markets, Frazer is well suited to lead Mandalay in executing our long-term objectives and maximizing shareholder value,” said executive chairperson Bradford Mills. He also thanked the outgoing CEO for his leadership over the last five years, noting that under Duffy had seen the company's reserves grow significantly and its balance sheet improve to the point where the company was able to start returning capital to its shareholders again. “Frazer inherits this strong foundation and the board believes that this positions the company for further success in the years ahead." Mandalay has producing assets in Australia and Sweden, with projects in Chile and Canada.
