Toronto-headquartered Vale Energy Transition Metals, a supplier of nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals, on Tuesday announced a partnership with the University of Toronto  to power sustainable mining solutions and foster Canadian skills and talent. The partnership, announced during the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada 2023 convention, brings together two Canadian leaders to drive innovation, build resilient communities and accelerate the next generation of sustainable critical mineral projects. Building on Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy launched last year, Vale will contribute an initial C$1.6-million over three years to the university, with a focus on decarbonisation and the energy transition economy. The partnership will include sponsored research projects, training, professional development and community engagement mechanisms. "This multiyear, strategic partnership is an important catalyst to accelerate and expand our portfolio of decarbonization efforts and circular mining knowledge," said Vale Energy Transition Metals executive VP Deshnee Naidoo. "For Vale, it means working in close co-operation with leading minds and researchers across a global network to drive innovation, expand the skills of our people and provide new ways to link to the communities where we operate," Naidoo said. An initial project will focus on improving commercial recovery of low-grade nickel-containing ultramafic ores, including around Thompson, Manitoba, where Vale has significant operations. "As our economy continues its transition toward carbon-free sources of energy, the supply of critical minerals — such as nickel and cobalt, among many others — will only become more important," said Leah Cowen, VP, research and innovation and strategic initiatives at the University of Toronto. "Through this new partnership, we are keeping Canada at the forefront of innovation, and further strengthening our position as a trusted global supplier of sustainably sourced critical minerals."
