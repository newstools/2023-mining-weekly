Minerals sands mining company Richards Bay Minerals (RBM), in KwaZulu-Natal, has taken robust measures to enhance its internal controls and prevent any further illegal activity within the organisation. This follows after a series of criminal activities, including product theft, severely undermined the company’s sustainability. The company says it is now better equipped to combat any such threats and ensure the safety and security of its assets. RBM has also started initial civil legal proceedings against certain parties it believes may have benefited from the theft of product from its operations. The South African Police Service (SAPS) has also started its own investigation into the matter. “RBM is grateful for the work of the SAPS, which has investigated alleged criminal activity causing harm to RBM’s business and contributing to instability in the region. “The work of the SAPS and our own investigation have highlighted activities which have had a significant detrimental impact on RBM,” the company says. RBM adds that it is not alone in facing operational and security challenges and that it appreciates the support of the police and government in addressing the matter. “RBM takes its response to this criminal activity seriously as it is committed to the safe operation of RBM, its host communities and the region,” the company says.
