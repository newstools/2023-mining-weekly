PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Vertically integrated graphite developer Evion has entered into a collaboration agreement with US-based battery anode material (BAM) developer Urbix Inc to assess the viability of a BAM plant in Europe. Graphite concentrate from Evion’s Maniry project, in Madagascar, will supply feedstock to the plant, providing a market for a substantial portion of Evion’s production capacity. The parties will collaborate on site identification, general feasibility and costing for the BAM plant in Europe, and subject to the positive outcome of the feasibility study, the two companies will establish a joint venture to construct and operate the proposed plant. Additional investors will likely be required to finance the project. Evion MD Tom Revy said on Thursday that processing graphite from the Maniry project into BAM was a major growth opportunity for Evion, given the pivotal role BAM plays in the production of lithium batteries and the electric vehicle industry. “Urbix is a highly experienced and well-regarded player in the BAM industry. Evion could not hope for a better partner as it looks to establish itself in this growth industry.”
