Three workers were killed in an underground collapse in a potash mine in northeastern Spain early on Thursday, regional union USOC said. The collapse at the mine in the town of Suria happened just before 9 a.m. local time (08:00 GMT), about 900 m underground, firefighters said, without going into further details. "We want to send our deepest condolences to the families of the three colleagues who lost their lives this morning doing their work," USOC said. Tel Aviv-based ICL Group, whose subsidiary Iberpotash operates the mine, said there had been an "unfortunate underground accident", in a statement released before the deaths were announced. The mine is about 80 km north of Barcelona in the region of Catalonia.
