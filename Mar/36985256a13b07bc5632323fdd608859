The Mexican Federal Administrative Court has granted Canadian firm Fortuna Silver Mines a permanent injunction, allowing the San Jose mine to continue to operate under the terms of its environmental impact authorisation (EIA). Fortuna president and CEO Jorge Ganoza said on Tuesday that the company was “extremely encouraged” by the court’s decision. “Once again, the court has agreed with our legal arguments and has granted us protection against this troubling and repeated attempt by SEMARNAT [Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales] to affect an EIA they themselves granted to the company only 13 months ago." SEMARNAT is re-assessing the 12-year extension to the EIA for the San Jose mine that it granted to Fortuna's Minera Cuzcatlan in December 2021. The injunction allows the San Jose mine to continue to operate under the terms of the 12-year EIA until this matter is resolved. Fortuna points out that Minera Cuzcatlan is in full compliance with all material environmental laws and continues to operate under the terms of the EIA.
