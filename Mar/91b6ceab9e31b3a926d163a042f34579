Toronto-listed Lundin Gold on Monday announced two senior management changes, including the appointment of former Pure Gold COO Terrence Smith and current VP of finance, Chester See, as interim CFO. The company also announced the retirement of Alessandro Bitelli as executive VP and CFO. “I am excited that Terry is joining Lundin Gold. He will be a great addition to our leadership team and has the right experience to enhance the company's ability to optimise and continue to expand operations at Fruta del Norte, and in doing so provide vital input as Lundin Gold looks to execute its growth strategy,” commented Lundin president and CEO Ron Hochstein. At the same time, he congratulated and wish Bitelli the best on his retirement. “Under Alessandro's leadership, Lundin Gold successfully financed the development of Fruta del Norte and is now in a strong financial position with an aggressive debt reduction strategy underway. We all thank him for his dedication and contribution to the company since 2016." Smith, who will be joining Lundin Gold as COO on March 13, is a mining engineer and experienced executive with more than 20 years in the industry. Prior to joining Lundin Gold, Smith served as COO at Pure Gold, where he was responsible for the ramp-up of the PureGold mine in Red Lake, Ontario, after a challenging startup. Pure Gold has filed for creditor protection. The namesake mine is currently shuttered. Smith’s previous work experience includes serving as chief development officer and as senior VP of operations with Coeur Mining, where he was responsible for Coeur's portfolio of precious metals mines and projects across the company.
